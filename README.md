# Data Visualization Exercises

These are the problems that we use for homework/in-class practice in STAT
436/479 at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. These are designed to give
some experience in using basic visualization tools (ggplot2, shiny, d3) and
applying them to problems common in data science (e.g., visualizing spatial or
high-dimensional data). The inspiration for compiling this came from my
experience working through exercise books on analysis and probability during my
undergraduate. Even with data visualization, the best way to learn is through
practice.

I'll keep this repository updated as I write new problems in new semesters.
You're also welcome to suggest or contribute new problems through email (see
below) or a [repository
issue](https://github.com/krisrs1128/data_visualization_exercises/issues).  If
you are an instructor, feel free to re-use any of the exercises here -- the
underlying `.Rmd` source code is in the `source/` subfolder. I can also share my
solutions (though, be forewarned that these are quite scattered).

And to any former students reading this -- thank you for all your effort! Your
motivation made this compilation exercise worthwhile.

### Contact

These exercises have been compiled over several years, and I hadn't originally
planned to share them beyond my classes. If you notice that I haven't properly
attributed a dataset that you gathered or otherwise find any issues, don't
hesitate to [reach out](https://measurement-and-microbes.org/_includes/contact).
